# Task App
With this app you can manage your taks: create, complete, cancel and mark as important. You can set a title and a description to each task. Check for it: [Task App](https://app-tasks-maganement.netlify.app)

## Saved tasks
Every change you make is saved. The tasks are saved in your browser (localStorage), making it possible for the application to always show your made notes even if you close the browser and enter again.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
